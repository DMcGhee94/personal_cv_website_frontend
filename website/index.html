                    <h2>Inov8 Consulting Ltd</h2>
                    <h3>Lead Consultant</h3>
                    <h4>June 2016 - Present</h4>
                    <p>
                        I joined Inov8 as a Trainee Consultant immediately after gaining my University degree and immediately 
                        got put into training with SAS which set me on the path to become a data professional.  
                        After one week with Inov8 and a fast track training course in SAS with Newtyne, 
                        I started a contract with Tesco Bank in the Credit Risk department to manage their ETL batch processes as 
                        part of a BAU (Business as Usual) role.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        Over the course of the next year, I attained both the base and advanced programmer certifications in 
                        SAS and was promoted from a trainee to a fully fledged consultant within Inov8 after completing my 
                        probation period.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        In the years to follow, I have completed various training courses in different areas of data engineering, 
                        gained multiple certifications in different languages and tools, completed various projects for our clients 
                        including a migration from SAS 9.2 (On-prem) to SAS 9.4 (in cloud) and built a full ETL pipeline for 
                        Collections & Recoveries data including BI Reporting.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        Within Inov8, I am in charge of running the systems we use to run the business including Microsoft Office, 
                        a third-party timesheet portal, Azure Active Directory, AWS, GCP and more.  
                        I also used tools like Microsoft Power Platform to automate some of the manual tasks that members of the business have to do manually, 
                        like sending out the payslips we receive from our accounting firm.  
                        Instead of sending them out via email manually, a Power Automate Flow will now detect the files arriving in the mailbox, 
                        process and load them into each employees private folder for documents like this and inform them that their slip is now available.  
                        Not only does this reduce the man hours required to complete tasks like this, but it also removes the manual element of it, 
                        reducing human error.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        Having built my skills within Inov8 and proven my reliability, I have worked my way up through the business,
                        being promoted to a Lead Consultant and now managing a team of between 4 and 6 people at a time.  Not only
                        that, but I am now closely involved in making decisions that affect the business and how it is run by providing
                        my opinions on suggested changes or ways of moving forward.<br/>

                    <h2>Arvato Financial Solutions</h2>
                    <h3>Collections Agent</h3>
                    <h4>August 2014 - June 2016</h4>
                    <p>
                        During my time at Arvato Financial Solutions, I was a telephony collections agent, primarily working in the 
                        British Gas department.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        This role had helped me build a lot of skills, both personal and professional that have been invaluable in my
                        future career.  The primary skill that I believe this role gave me was confidence to discuss hard situations
                        with customers while allowing me to determine the root of the issue and devise the best course of action to 
                        take that will benefit the customer the most.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        As this role was entirely customer facing to deal with issues relating to debt accrued between a customer 
                        and a large business, it has given me a unique view of how to manage the collections and recoveries processes. 
                        This has proven useful during contracts I have been involved with in the financial sector while working for 
                        Inov8 Consulting Ltd.<br/>

                    <h2>Tesco Bank (Via Inov8 Consulting Ltd)</h2>
                    <h3>Regulatory Reporting Developer</h3>
                    <h4>October 2023 - Present</h4>
                    <p>
                        I was brought in to Tesco Bank specifically to work on an urgent regulatory request from the Financial Conduct Authority 
                        (FCA) regarding Credit Card customers in persistent debt.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        This involed sourcing 200+ metrics on a sample of accounts for each of their statements for a period of roughly 7 years.  
                        This sampling was determined by account characteristics which was re-assessed for each month within the date period.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        The request itself was segmented into 4 separate sub-reports, the first 2 of which have been successfully completed and 
                        supplied to the FCA, the remaining 2 are in progress currently.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        This has been a fantastic contract for me to work on, allowing me to use my extensive Tesco Bank Credit Card's knowledge, 
                        SAS programming skills, data management best practices and stakeholder management capabilities.  Not only that, due to the 
                        amount of time it takes to run 7 years worth of data, having to make the process as efficient as possible, and also simple 
                        to re-run and produce the same result was absolutely paramount to this projects success.<br/>

                    <h4>November 2022 - June 2023</h4>
                    <p>
                        Due to a number of high priority projects that were ongoing within Tesco Bank that required a lot of business knowledge on 
                        those specific products, some extra resource was needed within the team so I was brought onboard to help support the BAU 
                        running of the team.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        This was primarily picking up new work requests that were required while the permanent staff were tied up with their projects, 
                        and dealing with any incidents that came up.  Primarily, this was developing SAS processes, whether new or modifying existing, 
                        however there was also some Power Platform work during this to maintain an app that I previously built for them to manage 
                        peer-reviews of tickets completed.<br/>
