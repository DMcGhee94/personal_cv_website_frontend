                    <p> 
                        Being a dedicated and curious developer, I enjoy looking into new ways of tackling problems, particularly with new technologies 
                        or methods/functions I may not have used before that could potentially be better in terms of efficiency or cost.  I have been primarily data focussed for the last 8 years, 
                        I am branching out into back-end engineering now as well in my own time as I really enjoy the interactions and automations that can be created.<br>

                    <h2>Inov8 Consulting Ltd</h2>
                    <h3>Lead Consultant</h3>
                    <h4>June 2016 - Present</h4>
                    <p>
                        I joined Inov8 as a Trainee Consultant immediately after gaining my University degree and immediately 
                        got put into training with SAS which set me on the path to become a data professional.  
                        After one week with Inov8 and a fast track training course in SAS with Newtyne, 
                        I started a contract with Tesco Bank in the Credit Risk department to manage their ETL batch processes as 
                        part of a BAU (Business as Usual) role.<br>
                        <br>
                        Over the course of the next year, I attained both the base and advanced programmer certifications in 
                        SAS and was promoted from a trainee to a fully fledged consultant within Inov8 after completing my 
                        probation period.<br>
                        <br>
                        In the years to follow, I have completed various training courses in different areas of data engineering, 
                        gained multiple certifications in different languages and tools, completed various projects for our clients 
                        including a migration from SAS 9.2 (On-prem) to SAS 9.4 (in cloud) and built a full ETL pipeline for 
                        Collections & Recoveries data including BI Reporting.<br>
                        <br>
                        Within Inov8, I am in charge of running the systems we use to run the business including Microsoft Office, 
                        a third-party timesheet portal, Azure Active Directory, AWS, GCP and more.  
                        I also used tools like Microsoft Power Platform to automate some of the manual tasks that members of the business have to do manually, 
                        like sending out the payslips we receive from our accounting firm.  
                        Instead of sending them out via email manually, a Power Automate Flow will now detect the files arriving in the mailbox, 
                        process and load them into each employees private folder for documents like this and inform them that their slip is now available.  
                        Not only does this reduce the man hours required to complete tasks like this, but it also removes the manual element of it, 
                        reducing human error.<br>
                        <br>
                        Having built my skills within Inov8 and proven my reliability, I have worked my way up through the business,
                        being promoted to a Lead Consultant and now managing a team of between 4 and 6 people at a time.  Not only
                        that, but I am now closely involved in making decisions that affect the business and how it is run by providing
                        my opinions on suggested changes or ways of moving forward.<br>

                    <h2>Arvato Financial Solutions</h2>
                    <h3>Collections Agent</h3>
                    <h4>August 2014 - June 2016</h4>
                    <p>
                        During my time at Arvato Financial Solutions, I was a telephony collections agent, primarily working in the 
                        British Gas department.<br>
                        <br>
                        This role had helped me build a lot of skills, both personal and professional that have been invaluable in my
                        future career.  The primary skill that I believe this role gave me was confidence to discuss hard situations
                        with customers while allowing me to determine the root of the issue and devise the best course of action to 
                        take that will benefit the customer the most.<br>
                        <br>
                        As this role was entirely customer facing to deal with issues relating to debt accrued between a customer 
                        and a large business, it has given me a unique view of how to manage the collections and recoveries processes. 
                        This has proven useful during contracts I have been involved with in the financial sector while working for 
                        Inov8 Consulting Ltd.<br>

                    <h3>Regulatory Reporting Developer</h3>
                    <h4>October 2023 - Present</h4>
                    <p>
                        I was brought in to Tesco Bank specifically to work on an urgent regulatory request from the Financial Conduct Authority 
                        (FCA) regarding Credit Card customers in persistent debt.<br>
                        <br>
                        This involed sourcing 200+ metrics on a sample of accounts for each of their statements for a period of roughly 7 years.  
                        This sampling was determined by account characteristics which was re-assessed for each month within the date period.<br>
                        <br>
                        The request itself was segmented into 4 separate sub-reports, the first 2 of which have been successfully completed and 
                        supplied to the FCA, the remaining 2 are in progress currently.<br>
                        <br>
                        This has been a fantastic contract for me to work on, allowing me to use my extensive Tesco Bank Credit Card's knowledge, 
                        SAS programming skills, data management best practices and stakeholder management capabilities.  Not only that, due to the 
                        amount of time it takes to run 7 years worth of data, having to make the process as efficient as possible, and also simple 
                        to re-run and produce the same result was absolutely paramount to this projects success.<br>

                    <h2>Tesco Bank (Via Inov8 Consulting Ltd)</h2>
                    <h3>Regulatory Reporting Developer</h3>
                    <h4>November 2022 - June 2023</h4>
                    <p>
                        Due to a number of high priority projects that were ongoing within Tesco Bank that required a lot of business knowledge on 
                        those specific products, some extra resource was needed within the team so I was brought onboard to help support the BAU 
                        running of the team.<br>
                        <br>
                        This was primarily picking up new work requests that were required while the permanent staff were tied up with their projects, 
                        and dealing with any incidents that came up.  Primarily, this was developing SAS processes, whether new or modifying existing, 
                        however there was also some Power Platform work during this to maintain an app that I previously built for them to manage 
                        peer-reviews of tickets completed.<br>

                    <h3>Power Platform Developer</h3>
                    <h4>August 2022 - February 2023</h4>
                    <p>
                        Having spent a lot of time within Inov8 developing solutions using Power Platform, this contract suited me very nicely.  The
                        client was looking to build a public facing application form ingestion process, storing the data in Microsoft SQL Server using
                        Power Platform.  This would be supported by a SharePoint site that the customers could upload their form to, each applicant 
                        would have a pre-provisioned and siloed folder that only they can see.<br>
                        <br>
                        Internally to the client, a Power App was built to act as a UI to interact with the data and trigger different actions such as
                        sending queries directly to the applicant, calculating scores for the application, and populating contract templates etc.
                        All of this is backed by Power Automate for the automation and SQL Server for data storage (Built in a Type 2 relational format).<br>

                    <p>
                        Initially, this contract was to support the Payment Holiday project that was on going due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  There was a lot
                        of building reports quickly to support customers, such as refunding interest and fees accrued on Payment Holiday's that were incorrect,
                        along with pulling mailing campaigns together before being sent to the letter production company.  While this was all done quickly to try
                        and achieve the best outcomes for the customers, we had to ensure there was thorough testing of the process and internal peer-review processes.<br>
                        <br>
                        Once a lot of the Covid-19 activities were either finished or were fully automated and just being monitored, I transitioned into more of a 
                        Business Intelligence role, primarly supporting the development of reporting dashboards in MicroStrategy.  Towards the end of the contract, 
                        I was supporting a transition project from MicroStrategy to PowerBI, which involved detailing all reports currently active in MicroStrategy,
                        and determining how these could be built in PowerBI.<br>
                        <br>
                        On the side of this, I built a Power App and Power Automate process to make it easier to track and manage internal peer-reviews, 
                        including automated notifications, assigning reviewer from list, and an approval/rejection process including commentary and confirming
                        required steps have been taken, both by the developer and the reviewer themselves.<br>

                    <p>
                        Following my time at Tesco Bank, and some Python and Spark/PySpark training, my next contract was with The Royal Bank of Scotland, specifically within 
                        the Technology function of the bank where Credit Risk processes were built.  The main aim of this contract was to migrate this code from running in SAS
                        to running in PySpark within AWS.  I had to develop tests to validate the newly migrated code as we were working in a Development environment
                        where we had no access to real data, so no chance of comparing results to the SAS outputs.<br>
                        <br>
                        Unfortunately, during this contract, the Covid-19 pandemic began, and projects started getting put on hold or cancelled completely, this being one of them.<br>

                    <p>
                        After successfully graduating from University with a bachelor's degree in Computing Information Systems Delivery, and a weeks crash course on using SAS, 
                        I began my first contract as a consultant within a a financial institution.  Being brough in as a trainee to support the Credit Risk Batch Services team
                        on their BAU activities was a great learning experience for myself as I could see ETL process in action built within SAS and automated via AutoSys.<br>
                        <br>
                        Not only did this contract give me a vast amount of experience in SAS programming and data management in general, I also gained a large amount of 
                        stakeholder management experience and really built my confidence in my own programming skills and knowledge.  I successfully assisted in delivering a 
                        number of projects during my time within this contract, including migrating our data and processes from SAS 9.2 (On-prem) to SAS 9.4 (On Cloud) 
                        and a full ETL build for a Credit Cards Collections & Recoveries data mart including PowerBI reporting.<br>
                        <br>
                        Having performed well during this contract, I was lucky enough to have my contract extended multiple times, and benefited from promotion within Inov8
                        itself.  All of this set me up and put me on the path I have been on now for many years.<br>

                    <h2>Resume/CV Website</h2>
                    <h3>Regulatory Reporting Developer</h3>
                    <p>
                        Recently I have been interested in branching out my skills into back-end engineering,
                        having been working through a course on 
                        <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/back-end-engineer-career-path" target="_blank">CodeCademy</a> to learn the skills required for
                        this field.<br>
                        <br>
                        To allow me to put these skills into practice and learn by doing, I decided to take the
                        <a href="https://cloudresumechallenge.dev">Cloud Resume Challenge</a>.  This challenge involves building your own website from scratch
                        to act as a Resume/CV, while also building up your skills in multiple different areas
                        that a front or back end engineering would need. <br>
                        <br>
                        The skills I have been able to put in to practice during this project are as follows:<br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>HTML & CSS</li>
                            <li>JavaScript</li>
                            <li>Node.js</li>
                            <li>Git/GitHub</li>
                            <li>API Development</li>
                            <li>Azure Cloud (Blob storage, CosmosDB, CDN, FrontDoor, etc)</li>
                            <li>DevOps Processes</li>
                            <li>CI/CD Pipelines</li>
                        </ul><br>
                        <br>
                        This project has been great for developing and testing my skills, I have always been
                        someone who learns by doing.  I like to use videos, tutorials and courses for getting
                        a foundational understanding of a new language or tool, but I really cement my learning
                        by trying to do something with that learning.<br>
                        <br>
                        Not only that, but building this website has given me a resume/CV that suits my profession
                        much better than the standard word document that has a standard template applied to it.  It
                        will hopefully set me apart from other developers in the field and make me stand out a bit more.
                        This will be an ongoing project that I will never stop working on, whether it is just adding more
                        certifications and contract history to, or redesigning completely or adding new content entirely.<br>
                        <br>
                        The source code for this project has been split into two separate repos on my GitHub, one for
                        the front-end and one of the back-end that supports the whole thing, they can be found here:<br>
                        <ul>
                            <li><a href="https://github.com/DMcGhee94/personal_cv_website_backend" target="_blank">Front End Repo</a></li>
                            <li><a href="https://github.com/DMcGhee94/personal_cv_website_frontend" target="_blank">Back End Repo</a></li>
                        </ul>
