                            <h2>Inov8 Consulting Ltd</h2>
                            <h3>Lead Consultant</h3>
                            <h4>June 2016 - Present</h4>
                            <p>
                                I joined Inov8 as a Trainee Consultant immediately after gaining my University degree and immediately 
                                got put into training with SAS which set me on the path to become a data professional.  
                                After one week with Inov8 and a fast track training course in SAS with Newtyne, 
                                I started a contract with Tesco Bank in the Credit Risk department to manage their ETL batch processes as 
                                part of a BAU (Business as Usual) role.<br/>
                                <br/>
                                Over the course of the next year, I attained both the base and advanced programmer certifications in 
                                SAS and was promoted from a trainee to a fully fledged consultant within Inov8 after completing my 
                                probation period.<br/>
                                <br/>
                                In the years to follow, I have completed various training courses in different areas of data engineering, 
                                gained multiple certifications in different languages and tools, completed various projects for our clients 
                                including a migration from SAS 9.2 (On-prem) to SAS 9.4 (in cloud) and built a full ETL pipeline for 
                                Collections & Recoveries data including BI Reporting.<br/>
                                <br/>
                                Within Inov8, I am in charge of running the systems we use to run the business including Microsoft Office, 
                                a third-party timesheet portal, Azure Active Directory, AWS, GCP and more.  
                                I also used tools like Microsoft Power Platform to automate some of the manual tasks that members of the business have to do manually, 
                                like sending out the payslips we receive from our accounting firm.  
                                Instead of sending them out via email manually, a Power Automate Flow will now detect the files arriving in the mailbox, 
                                process and load them into each employees private folder for documents like this and inform them that their slip is now available.  
                                Not only does this reduce the man hours required to complete tasks like this, but it also removes the manual element of it, 
                                reducing human error.<br/>
                                <br/>
                                Having built my skills within Inov8 and proven my reliability, I have worked my way up through the business,
                                being promoted to a Lead Consultant and now managing a team of between 4 and 6 people at a time.  Not only
                                that, but I am now closely involved in making decisions that affect the business and how it is run by providing
                                my opinions on suggested changes or ways of moving forward.<br/>

                            <h2>Arvato Financial Solutions</h2>
                            <h3>Collections Agent</h3>
                            <h4>August 2014 - June 2016</h4>
                            <p>
                                During my time at Arvato Financial Solutions, I was a telephony collections agent, primarily working in the 
                                British Gas department.<br/>
                                <br/>
                                This role had helped me build a lot of skills, both personal and professional that have been invaluable in my
                                future career.  The primary skill that I believe this role gave me was confidence to discuss hard situations
                                with customers while allowing me to determine the root of the issue and devise the best course of action to 
                                take that will benefit the customer the most.<br/>
                                <br/>
                                As this role was entirely customer facing to deal with issues relating to debt accrued between a customer 
                                and a large business, it has given me a unique view of how to manage the collections and recoveries processes. 
                                This has proven useful during contracts I have been involved with in the financial sector while working for 
                                Inov8 Consulting Ltd.<br/>
